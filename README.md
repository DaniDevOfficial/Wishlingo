## About

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly software for learning new languages. The application presents a sentence in one language and then displays the same sentence in another language, with a missing word that the user needs to fill in. It then provides feedback on the correctness of the input and shows the correct answer if necessary.

You can extend this basic concept by adding more features, such as multiple gaps in a sentence, an input form for adding new sentences, or multiple correct answers. However, remember that quality is more important than quantity, so prioritize a well-functioning application over adding many features with potential bugs.

## Example

Original Sentence: "Working at a company is a great experience!"
Translated Sentence: "Bei einer Firma zu arbeiten ist eine grossartige ________!"
User Input: "Erfahrung"
Feedback: "Correct!"



### local installation:

1. clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/David21092/Wishlingo
```

2. cd into cloned repo

```
cd Wishlingo
```

3. install dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

```
npm install firebase 
```

```
npm install @firebase/app
```

```
npm install react-toastify
```

4. Create Firebase DB

Due to the fact that you cant use my firebase realtime DB because i would have to give out my Tokens, you need to create your own one and just simply connect it with the app. This File should be called "firebase.jsx", its located in the src folder and should look something like this: 

<br/>import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
<br/>import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'
<br/>
<br/>const firebaseConfig = {
<br/>  apiKey: "YOUR_TEMP_API_KEY",
<br/>  authDomain: "YOUR_TEMP_AUTH_DOMAIN",
<br/>  databaseURL: "YOUR_TEMP_DATABASE_URL",
<br/>  projectId: "YOUR_TEMP_PROJECT_ID",
<br/>  storageBucket: "YOUR_TEMP_STORAGE_BUCKET",
<br/>  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_TEMP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
<br/>  appId: "YOUR_TEMP_APP_ID"
<br/>};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = getAuth(app);


5. run the app

```
npm run start
```
